## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Firebase account and project setup
- Android Studio or Xcode for emulator/device testing

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/najat-ttt/SAMS_Basic.git
cd SAMS_Basic

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get
```

### Configure Firebase

To connect the app to your Firebase project:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project
2. Add an **Android** app and/or an **iOS** app in your project settings
3. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it inside the `android/app/` directory
4. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and place it inside the `ios/Runner/` directory
5. Make sure to enable required Firebase services like **Authentication** and **Firestore Database**

> For detailed setup instructions, refer to the official [FlutterFire documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview)

### Run the App

Once everything is set up, start the app on your connected device or emulator:

```bash
flutter run
```

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Flutter SDK version matches the project requirement (**`sdk: ^3.7.0`**)
- If you encounter Firebase-related build errors:
  - Verify that `google-services.json` is correctly placed inside `android/app/`
  - Verify that `GoogleService-Info.plist` is correctly placed inside `ios/Runner/`
- Run the following command to check if your development environment is properly set up:

```bash
flutter doctor
```
